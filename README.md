# Playground

## Installation

- Fork this project from github
- Create the project
- Make a pull request

## Goal

Create a library that will export 2 functions:

### isPrimeNumber(number)

Returns true / false depending if the number is prime of not

- Should throw an error if the number is negative
- Should have a coverage of 100%

### getNthPrimeNumber(number)

Returns the nth prime number. For example I would like to know
what is the 100000th prime number. This is a good test for speed
and thinking about algorithm improvement.
